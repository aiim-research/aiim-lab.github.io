<p>The project aims to strengthen the SoBigData research infrastructure (www.sobigdata.eu), coordinated by CNR-ISTI, with the goal of enhancing interdisciplinary and innovative research on the multiple aspects of social complexity by combining data and model-driven approach. SoBigData emphasizes the concept of “responsible data science”, considering the ethical values as one of the pillars of reliable use of big data analytics and artificial intelligence technologies. Consequently, SoBigData RI develops methodologies and approaches to put into practice the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) and FACT (Fair, Accurate, Confidential, and Transparent) principles. The strengthening will concern four main aspects of the infrastructure: (i) Technological aspect: strengthening and creating new computational nodes distributed on the Italian territory with centralized and networking technologies; (ii) Scientific aspect: strengthening and creating new virtual laboratories (VL) to explore specific aspects of society through data science; (iii) Ethical Aspect: Promote the new generation of “responsible data scientists” collaborating with the academia and industry (i.e., providing ethical and legal counseling and facilitating the technology transfer); finally (iv) the creation of DIGIT services for multidisciplinary communities by exploiting the research produced in the VL and the new computational and technological resources. The RI will tackle complex social phenomena such as (but not limited to): Social Impact of AI and explainable machine learning, Societal Debates, and Misinformation Analysis, Disaster response and recovery, Societal and industrial impact of Next-Generation Internet beyond 5G networks. SoBigData is the result of two H2020 grants (grant n.654024 and 871042) and is part of the ESFRI Roadmap 2021.</p>
